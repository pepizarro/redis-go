# Redis in Go

This is a simple implementation of ["Redis"](https://redis.io/) written in Golang. 
It is my solution to the ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis) challenge from [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/).

### Features

This implementation has the following extensions:

- **RDB Persistence**
- **Streams**
- **Replication**
- **Transactions**
